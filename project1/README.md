# Causal Impact Analysis with sklearn

This project analyzes the causal effect of a new marketing intervention (daily Twitter promotions) on a blog's daily visitor count. Instead of using specialized libraries, this analysis uses a robust and stable approach with scikit-learn to measure the impact.

Project Goal: To statistically measure the additional traffic (lift) generated by the Twitter promotions, separating its effect from normal daily trends and seasonality.

### 🚀 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas: For data manipulation and time-series handling.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): Specifically, LinearRegression to build the predictive model.

Matplotlib: To visualize the results.

### methodology

The core idea is to model the "counterfactual"—what would have happened if the promotions had never started?

To do this, a LinearRegression model is trained only on the "Pre-Intervention" data (Jan 1 - Aug 31). The model learns the blog's "normal" traffic pattern based on its growth trend and seasonality.

It then predicts the traffic for the entire period, including September. This prediction serves as a baseline of what would have happened. The difference between this baseline and the actual traffic is the causal impact of the promotion.

### 📊 Results & Interpretation

The results of the analysis are summarized in the following visualizations and report.

Graph 1: Actual vs. Predicted (Counterfactual)

This graph shows the core of the analysis.

Blue Dotted Line (Tahmin): The model's prediction of what "normal" traffic would have been without any promotions.

Red Line (Gerçek Ziyaretçi): The actual traffic the blog received.

Black Dotted Line (Müdahale Günü): The date the Twitter promotions began (Sep 1).

Interpretation: Before the intervention, the red and blue lines follow each other closely, showing the model is accurate. After the black line, the Red Line (Actual) is consistently above the Blue Line (Predicted). This gap is the positive impact of the promotions.

Graph 2: Estimated Daily Impact

This graph plots the difference (Actual - Predicted) from the chart above.

Interpretation: This chart isolates the "lift" or "extra" visitors. After the promotion starts, the line stays almost entirely above 0, showing a consistent, positive daily effect.

### Final Report

The numbers quantify the visual evidence:

--- ETKİ ANALİZİ RAPORU (Eylül Ayı) --- Twitter tanıtımı, Eylül ayı boyunca toplamda yaklaşık 1000 ekstra ziyaretçi getirdi. Bu, günlük ortalama 34.5 ekstra ziyaretçi anlamına geliyor.

(--- IMPACT ANALYSIS REPORT (September) --- The Twitter promotion brought in a total of approximately 1000 extra visitors during September. This means a daily average of 34.5 extra visitors.)

### 🏁 Conclusion
The analysis statistically demonstrates that the Twitter promotion had a significant and positive causal impact on blog traffic. By modeling the counterfactual, we were able to isolate the effect of the promotion and quantify its value, attributing approximately 1000 additional visitors to it in September.
